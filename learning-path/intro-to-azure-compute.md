# [Core Cloud Services - Azure compute options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute/)

## [Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute/1-introduction)

- Identify compute options in Azure
- Select compute options that are appropriate for your business

## [Essential Azure compute concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute/2-essential-azure-compute-concepts)

Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications.

There are four common techniques for performing compute in Azure:
- Virtual machines
- Containers
- Azure App Service
- Serverless computing

## [Explore Azure Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-compute/3-virtual-machines)

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) let you create and use virtual machines in the cloud. They provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways.

### Scaling VMs in Azure

#### What are availability sets?
An availability set is a logical grouping of two or more VMs that help keep your application available during planned or unplanned maintenance.

#### What are virtual machine scale sets?
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs.

#### What is Azure Batch?
Azure Batch enables large-scale job scheduling and compute management with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs.
