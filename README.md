# Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
[(* This exam will be updated on May 28, 2020)](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY)

This repository is meant to help you get certified in **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**. The information and objectives in this repository is based on the Microsoft website: 
[Azure fundamentals learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)

- Learn cloud concepts such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery
- Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
- Compare and contrast basic strategies for transitioning to the Azure cloud
- Explore the breadth of services available in Azure including compute, network, storage, and security

## Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing

### [Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/1-introduction)

In this module, you will:
- Explore common cloud computing services
- Explore the benefits of cloud computing
- Decide which cloud deployment model is best for you

### [What is cloud computing?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/2-what-is-cloud-computing)

The cloud provider is responsible for the physical hardware required to execute your work, and for keeping it up-to-date. The computing services offered tend to vary by cloud provider. However, typically they include:

- **Compute power** - such as Linux servers or web applications
- **Storage** - such as files and databases
- **Networking** - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company
- **Analytics** - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data

### [Benefits of cloud computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/3-benefits-of-cloud-computing)

- **It's cost-effective**: pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model)
- **It's scalable**
    - **Vertical scaling**, also known as "scaling up", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server.
    - **Horizontal scaling**, also known as "scaling out", is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit.
- **It's elastic**: dynamic scaling
- **It's current**: maintained and upgraded by the cloud provider
- **It's reliable**: fault tolerance
- **It's global**: fully redundant datacenters located in various regions all over the globe
- **It's secure**: broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technical skills

### [Compliance terms and requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/3a-compliance)

Compliance Offerings
- Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS)
- Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Certification
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
EU Model Clauses
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS) Singapore
- Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1, 2, and 3
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- UK Government G-Cloud

### [Economies of scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/3b-economies-of-scale)

This cost advantage is an important benefit in cloud computing. Th cloud providers can then pass the savings on to their customers.

### [Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/3c-capex-vs-opex)

#### CapEx computing costs
- Server costs
- Storage costs
- Backup and archive costs
- Organization continuity and disaster recovery costs
- Datacenter infrastructure costs
- Technical personnel

#### OpEx cloud computing costs
- Leasing software and customized features
- Scaling charges based on usage/demand instead of fixed hardware or capacity
- Billing at the user or organization level
